        benefit, except that an authorized employee or agent may create an Account on behalf of your business. By
        granting other Users permissions under your Account,
        including as a Team Member or Agency
        Member, you represent and warrant that:
    </p>
    <p>

        liabilities relating to making payments and entering into Service Contracts and the Terms of Service. If any
        such User violates the Terms of Service, it may affect your ability to use the Site and Site Services.
        Upon closure of an Account, Kebet may close any or all related Accounts.
    </p>
    <h3>IDENTITY AND LOCATION VERIFICATION </h3>
    <p>
        When you register for an Account and from time to time thereafter, your Account will be subject to verification,
        including, but not limited to, validation against third-party databases or the verification of one or more
        official government or legal documents that confirm your identity, your location, and your ability to act on
        behalf of your business on Kebet. You authorize Kebet, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries
        necessary to validate your identity, your location, and confirm your ownership of your email address or
        financial accounts, subject to applicable law. When requested, you must timely provide us with complete
        information about yourself and your business, which includes, but is not limited to, providing official
        government or legal documents. During verification some Account features may be temporarily limited.
        When a verification is successfully completed, Account features will be restored.
    </p>

<div id="PURPOSEOFKEBET" class="collapse col-12">
    <h1>PURPOSE OF KEBET </h1>
    <p>Section 2 discusses what Kebet does and does not do when providing the Site and Site Services and some of your responsibilities when using the Site to find or 
        enter into a Service Contract with a Freelancer or Client, as detailed below. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Site is a marketplace where Clients and Freelancers can identify each other and advertise, buy, and sell Freelancer Services online. Subject to the Terms of Service, Kebet provides the Site Services to Users, including hosting and maintaining the Site, facilitating the formation of Service Contracts, and assisting Users in resolving disputes which may arise in connection with those Service Contracts. When a User enters a Service Contract, the User
         uses the Site to invoice and pay any amounts owed under the Service Contract. 
    </p>
    <h3>RELATIONSHIP WITH KEBET </h3>
    <p>
        Kebet merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable Freelancers and Clients to find and transact directly with each other.
         Kebet does not introduce Freelancers to Clients, find Projects for 
    </p>
    <p>
        Freelancers, or find Freelancers for Clients. Through the Site and Site Services, Freelancers may be notified of Clients that may be seeking the services they offer, and Clients may be notified of Freelancers that may offer the services they seek; at all times, however, Users are responsible for evaluating and determining the suitability of any Project, Client or Freelancer on their own. If Users decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is
         directly between the Users and Kebet is not a party to that Service Contract. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Kebet is not a party to the relationship or any dealings between 
        Client and Freelancer. Without limitation, Users are solely responsible for:

        (c) negotiating, agreeing to, and executing any terms or conditions of Service Contracts; 

    </p>
    <p>
        (d) performing Freelancer Services; or

        (e) paying for Freelancer Services. You further acknowledge, agree, and understand that you are solely responsible for assessing whether to enter into a Service Contract with another User and for verifying any information about another User, including Composite Information (defined below). Kebet does not make any representations about or guarantee the truth or accuracy of any Freelancer’s or Client’s listings or other User Content on the Site; does not verify any feedback or information provided by Users about Freelancers or Clients; and does not vet or otherwise perform background checks on Freelancers or Clients. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Kebet does not, in any way, supervise, direct, control, or evaluate Freelancers or their work and is not responsible for any Project, Project terms or Work Product. Kebet makes no representations about and does not guarantee, and you agree not to hold Kebet responsible for, the quality, safety, or legality of Freelancer Services; the qualifications, background, or identities of Users; the ability of Freelancers to deliver Freelancer Services; the ability of Clients to pay for Freelancer Services; User Content and statements or posts made by Users; or the ability or willingness of 
        a Client or Freelancer to actually complete a transaction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You also acknowledge, agree, and understand that Freelancers are solely responsible for determining, and have the sole right to determine, which Projects to accept; the time, place, manner, and means of providing any Freelancer Services; the type of services they provide; and the price they charge for their services or how that pricing is determined or set. You further acknowledge, agree, and understand that:

    <p>
        Kebet does not provide shipping services for any physical Work Product. If a Freelancer uses subcontractors or employees, Freelancer further agrees and acknowledges that this Section applies to Kebet’s relationship, if any, with Freelancer’s subcontractors and employees as well and Freelancer is solely responsible for Freelancer’s subcontractors and employees.

Users are free at all times to engage in such other business activities and services and are encouraged to do so. <br><br>

    </p>
    <h3>TAXES AND BENEFITS </h3>
    <p>
        Freelancer acknowledges and agrees that Freelancer is solely responsible <br><br>
(a) for all tax liability associated with payments received from Freelancer’s Clients and through Kebet, and that Kebet will not withhold any taxes from payments to Freelancer; <br><br>
(b) to obtain any liability, health, workers’ compensation, disability, unemployment, or other insurance needed, desired, or required by law, and that Freelancer is not covered by or eligible for any insurance from Kebet; <br><br>
 (c) for determining whether Freelancer is required by applicable law to issue any particular invoices for the Freelancer Fees and for issuing any invoices so required; <br><br>
(d) for determining whether Freelancer is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Freelancer Fees and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities, as appropriate; and<br><br>

    </p>
    <h3>MARKETPLACE FEEDBACK AND USER CONTENT </h3>
    <p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that Users publish and request Kebet to publish on their behalf information on the Site about the User, such as feedback, composite feedback, geographical location, or verification of identity or credentials. However, such information is based solely on unverified data that Freelancers or Clients voluntarily submit to Kebet and does not constitute and will not be construed as an introduction, endorsement, or recommendation by Kebet; Kebet provides such information solely for the convenience of Users. <br><br>
        You acknowledge and agree that User feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Kebet post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score, wherever referenced, and other User Content highlighted by Kebet on the Site or otherwise (“Composite Information”), if any, may include User comments, User ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left exclusively by other Users. You further acknowledge and agree that Kebet will make Composite Information available to other Users, including composite or compiled feedback. Kebet provides its feedback system as a means through which Users can share their opinions of other Users publicly, and Kebet does not monitor, influence, contribute to or censor these opinions. You acknowledge and agree that posted composite or compiled feedback and any other Composite Information relates only to the business advertised in the Profile and not to any individual person. You agree not to use the Composite Information to make any employment, credit, credit valuation, underwriting, or other similar decision about any other User. <br><br>
        Kebet does not generally investigate any remarks posted by Users or other User Content for accuracy or reliability and does not guarantee that User Content is accurate. You are solely responsible for your User Content, including the accuracy of any User Content, and are solely responsible for any legal action that may be instituted by other Users or third parties as a result of or in connection with your User Content. Kebet is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Site by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. In order to protect the integrity of the feedback system and protect Users from abuse, Kebet reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that, in Kebet sole judgment, violates the Terms of Service or negatively affects our marketplace, diminishes the integrity of the feedback system or otherwise is inconsistent with the business interests of Kebet. You acknowledge and agree that you will notify Kebet of any error or inaccurate statement in your feedback results, including the Composite Information, and that if you do not do so, Kebet may rely on the accuracy of such information. <br><br>

<div id="CONTRACTUALRELATIONSHIPBETWEENCLIENTANDFREELANCER" class="collapse col-12">
    <h1> CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND FREELANCER </h1>
    Section 3 discusses the relationship you may decide to enter into with another User, including Service Contracts between Users, as detailed below. <br><br>
    <h2> SERVICE CONTRACTS </h2>
    If a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Client and Freelancer. Client and Freelancer have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Kebet is not a party to any 
    Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Kebet and any User or a partnership or joint venture between Kebet and any User. <br><br>
    With respect to any Service Contract, Clients and Freelancers may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Kebet’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. The parties to a Service Contract can, if the parties prefer, agree to the Optional Service Contract Terms in whole or in part, in addition to or instead of other such agreements. Only to the extent that they have not entered into another agreement or terms with respect to a Service Contract, the parties to a Service Contract agree that the Optional Service Contract Terms apply to their Service Contract. <br><br>
    The Optional Service Contract Terms are provided as a sample only and may not be appropriate for all jurisdictions or all contracts. Users are responsible for complying with any local requirements, including applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Kebet does not assume any responsibility for any consequence of using the Optional Service Contract Terms. The Optional Service Contract Terms are not intended to and do not <br><br>
    (a) constitute legal advice, <br><br>
    (b) create an attorney-client relationship, or <br><br>
    (c) constitute advertising or a solicitation of any type. Each situation is highly fact-specific and requirements vary by situation and jurisdiction and therefore any party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdictions. Kebet expressly disclaims any and all liability with respect to actions or omissions based on the Optional Service Contract Terms. <br><br>
    Please refer to the Kebet Payroll Agreement for Service Contracts using Kebet Payroll. <br><br>
    <h2> DISPUTES AMONG USERS </h2>
    For disputes arising between Clients and Freelancers, you agree to abide by the dispute process that is explained in the Escrow Instructions that apply to your particular Service Contract. If the dispute process does not resolve your dispute, you may pursue your dispute independently, but you acknowledge and agree that Kebet will not and is not obligated to provide any dispute assistance beyond what is provided in the Escrow Instructions. <br><br>
    If Freelancer or Client intends to obtain an order from any arbitrator or any court that might direct Kebet, Kebet Escrow, or our Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to an Escrow Account, that party will <br><br>
    (a) give us at least five business days’ prior notice of the hearing; <br><br>
    (b) include in any such order a provision that, as a precondition to obligation affecting Kebet or Kebet Escrow, we be paid in full for any amounts to which we would otherwise be entitled; and <br><br>
    (c) be paid for the reasonable value of the services to be rendered pursuant to such order. <br><br>
    <h2> CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION </h2>
    Users may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to confidentiality, including those set forth in the Optional Service Contract Terms. If and to the extent that the Users do not articulate any different agreement with regard to confidentiality, then they agree that this Section 3.3 (Confidential Information) applies. <br><br>

    . <h1> WORKER CLASSIFICATION AND UPWORK PAYROLL </h1>
    Section 4 discusses what you agree to concerning whether a Freelancer is an employee or independent contractor and when you agree to use Kebet Payroll, as detailed below. 
    <h2> WORKER CLASSIFICATION </h2>
    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or employer-employee relationship between Kebet and a User. <br><br>
    Client is solely responsible for and has complete discretion with regard to selection of any Freelancer for any Project. Client is solely responsible for and assumes all liability for determining whether Freelancers should be engaged as independent contractors or employees of Client and engaging them accordingly. Client warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct and its manner of engaging Freelancers complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. Kebet will have no input into, or involvement in, worker classification as between Client and Freelancer and Users agree that Kebet has no involvement in and will have no liability arising from or relating to the classification of a Freelancer generally or with regard to a particular Project. <br><br>
    <h2> KEBET PAYROLL SERVICES </h2>
    Client agrees to enroll in Kebet Payroll if it will receive services from a Freelancer under terms and conditions that would give rise to an employment relationship (unless Client elects instead to pay the Conversion Fee (see Section 7)). When the Client enrolls in Kebet Payroll, Client will engage Kebet’s third-party staffing vendor (the “Staffing Provider”), which is an Agency on Kebet, through the Site. The Staffing Provider will hire Freelancer at the request of Client and Freelancer according to the terms described on the Site and otherwise agreed to by the Staffing Provider and Client and/or Freelancer, and subject to the Kebet Payroll Agreement. For all purposes with Kebet Payroll, the employer of Freelancer will be the Staffing Provider and not Kebet under any circumstances. <br><br>
    Freelancer, acknowledges, understands, and agrees that Kebet will have no control over, or involvement in determining or influencing, the terms and conditions of any employment relationship that may arise between Freelancer and Staffing Provider or Client, including the selection of an employee, pay rate, work hours, employment dates and working conditions. Freelancer will not have any contract on the Site or contact with Kebet regarding such employment terms. Where Freelancer and Client have enrolled in Kebet Payroll the Site is provided for, and Users agree to use the Site for, the sole purpose of enabling Freelancer to communicate with the Staffing Provider and the Client. <br><br>

<div id="KEBETFEES " class="collapse col-12">
    <h1> KEBET FEES </h1>
    Section 5 describes what fees you agree to pay to Kebet and what taxes Kebet may collect, as detailed below. 
    5.1 <h2> VAT AND OTHER TAXES </h2>
    Kebet may be required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies including, without limitation, withholding income tax or VAT in the jurisdiction of the Freelancer (the "Taxes"). In such instances, any amounts Kebet is required to collect or withhold for the payment of any such Taxes shall be collected in addition to the fees owed to Kebet under the Terms of Service. 
    <h2> NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS </h2>
    Kebet does not introduce Clients to Freelancers and does not help Freelancers secure Projects. Kebet merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable Freelancers to do so themselves and may from time to time highlight Projects that may be of interest. Therefore, Kebet does not charge a fee when a Freelancer finds a suitable Client or finds a Project. In addition, Kebet does not charge any fee or dues for posting public feedback and composite or compiled feedback, including Composite Information.

<div id="PAYMENTTERMSANDESCROWSERVICES" class="collapse col-12">
    <h1> PAYMENT TERMS AND ESCROW SERVICES </h1>
    Section 6 discusses your agreement to pay Freelancer Service Fees on Service Contracts, and describes how Kebet’s Escrow Services work, what happens if a Client doesn’t pay, and related topics, as detailed below. 
    <h2> ESCROW SERVICES </h2>
    Kebet Escrow provides escrow services to Users to deliver, hold, and/or receive payment for a Project. The Escrow Services are intended for business use, and you agree to use the Escrow Services only for business purposes and not for consumer, personal, family, or household purposes. 
    <h3> ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    Kebet Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. You acknowledge and agree that Kebet Escrow acts merely as an Internet escrow agent. Kebet Escrow has fully delivered the Escrow Services to you if Kebet Escrow provides the Escrow Services described in this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Kebet Escrow is only obligated to perform those duties expressly described in this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions. If you authorize or instruct Kebet Escrow to release or make a payment of funds from an Escrow Account associated with you, Kebet Escrow may release or pay those funds as instructed in reliance on your authorization, this Agreement, and the applicable Escrow Instructions or as required by applicable law. <br><br>
    Fixed-Price Projects. If Users choose fixed-price compensation, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Kebet Escrow will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions. <br><br>
    Hourly Projects, Bonus Payments, or Expense Payments. If Users choose hourly compensation, and/or if the Client makes bonus or expense payments, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Kebet Escrow will follow, the Hourly, Bonus and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions. <br><br> 
    Direct Contracts. If Users enter into a Direct Contract, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Kebet Escrow will follow, the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions. <br><br>
    Kebet Payroll Engagements. If Users use Kebet Payroll (Section 4) for a particular Project, then the Staffing Employee is paid directly by the Staffing Provider. A Client will be invoiced through the Site by the Staffing Provider, and the applicable Escrow Instructions will apply. However, the Client will not be able to dispute hours reported by the Staffing Employee and there is no waiting period for the disbursement of 
    funds to the Staffing Employee. <br><br>
    ESCROW ACCOUNTS <br><br>
    Kebet Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Depending on your needs and the applicable Escrow Instructions, Kebet Escrow will establish and maintain one of three different types of Escrow Accounts: <br><br>
    (a) Client Escrow Account. After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Client makes a payment for a Project, Kebet Escrow will establish and maintain a “Client Escrow Account” to hold funds for the Client to use to make payments for Projects, to receive refunds in connection with Projects, and to make payments to Kebet. <br><br>
    (b) Freelancer Escrow Account. After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Freelancer uses the Site to receive payment for a Project, Kebet Escrow will establish and maintain a “Freelancer Escrow Account” for Freelancer to receive payments for Projects, withdraw payments, make payments to Kebet and issue refunds to Clients. <br><br>
    (c) Fixed-Price Escrow Account. When you enter into a Fixed-Price Contract, Kebet Escrow will establish and maintain a “Fixed-Price Escrow Account” to receive, hold, and release payments pursuant to the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions for the Project that is the subject of that Fixed-Price Contract. <br><br>
    (d) Direct Contract Escrow Account. When you enter into a Direct Contract, Kebet Escrow will establish and maintain a “Direct Contract Escrow Account” to receive, hold, and release payments pursuant to the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions for the Project that is the subject of that Direct Contract. <br><br>
    You hereby authorize and instruct Kebet Escrow to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Project and other specified purposes in accordance with the Terms of Service and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Client and Freelancer may access current information regarding the status of an Escrow Account on the Site. <br><br>
    
    
    
    FREELANCER APPOINTMENT OF UPWORK ESCROW AND SUBSIDIARIES AS AGENT <br><br>
    If you are a Freelancer and you request payment related to an Hourly Contract or the release of funds from a Fixed-Price Escrow Account, you hereby appoint Kebet Escrow and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as your agent to obtain funds on your behalf and credit them to your Freelancer Escrow Account as applicable. Because Kebet Escrow is Freelancer’s agent, Freelancer must, and hereby does, fully discharge and credit Freelancer’s Client for all payments and releases that Kebet Escrow receives on Freelancer’s behalf from or on behalf of such Client. <br><br>
    TITLE TO FUNDS <br><br>
    Kebet, Kebet Escrow and our Affiliates are banks. Kebet Escrow deposits and maintains all Escrow Account funds in an escrow trust account at a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and approved to receive, hold, and deliver escrow funds under applicable laws and regulations. The escrow trust account is separate from the operating accounts of Kebet and each of our Affiliates. Kebet Escrow will not voluntarily make funds deposited in the escrow trust account available to its creditors, or the creditors of its Affiliates, in the event of a bankruptcy, or for any other purpose. This Agreement is supplementary to the Service Contract and to any other agreement between Client and Freelancer concerning the Project. <br><br>
     NO INTEREST <br><br>
    You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held in your Escrow Account. Kebet, Kebet Escrow, or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged, and may receive other compensation in connection with the services they provide as provided in Section 5 and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement. <br><br>
    ESCROW AGENT DUTIES <br><br>
    We undertake to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service, and no other duties will be implied. We have no liability under, and no duty to inquire as to, the provisions of any agreement, other than the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. We will be under no duty to inquire about or investigate any agreement or communication between Client and Freelancer, even if posted to the Site. We have the right to rely upon, and will not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon, any written notice, instruction, or request furnished to us by Client or Freelancer in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, if we reasonably believe that such notice, instruction, or request is genuine and that it is signed or presented by the proper party or parties. We have no duty to inquire about or investigate the validity, accuracy, or content of any such notice, instruction, or request. We have no duty to solicit any payments or releases that may be due to or from any Escrow Account. We may execute any of our powers and perform any of our duties under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions directly or through agents or attorneys (and will be liable only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants, and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by us. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for anything done, suffered, or omitted in good faith by us in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants, or other skilled persons. If we are uncertain as to our duties or rights hereunder or receive instructions, claims, or demands from any party hereto that, in our opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, we will be entitled to refrain from taking any action, and our sole obligation will be to keep safely all property held in the Escrow Account until we are directed otherwise in writing by Client and Freelancer or by a final order or judgment of an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction. <br><br>
     ESCROW AGENT RIGHT <br><br>
    We have the right, in our sole discretion, but not the obligation, to institute arbitration or, if no arbitration provision applies, other legal proceedings, including depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction, and to resolve any dispute between Client and Freelancer related to the Escrow Account. Any provision of this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless whether we are identified as a party in interest in any dispute, arbitration, or other legal proceeding, nothing herein will be construed to limit our legal and equitable rights, including, but not limited to, depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction. Any corporation or association into which Kebet Escrow may be merged or converted or with which Kebet Escrow may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all the escrow business of Kebet Escrow may be transferred will succeed to all the rights and obligations of Kebet Escrow as escrow holder and escrow agent under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions without further act to the extent permitted by applicable law. <br><br>
    <h2> CLIENT PAYMENTS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS </h2>
    Hourly Contracts. Freelancer will invoice Client for Freelancer Fees on a weekly basis through Kebet, and Client will pay invoices consistent with the Hourly Escrow Instructions. When Client approves an Hourly Invoice for an Hourly Contract, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Kebet or its Affiliate, Kebet Escrow to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees. <br><br>
    Fixed-Price Contracts. Client becomes obligated to pay applicable amounts into the Escrow Account immediately upon sending a Fixed-Price Contract offer (for the full amount or for the first milestone, if milestones are used) or upon activating any additional milestone. When Client authorizes the payment of the Freelancer Fees for a Fixed-Price Contract on the Site, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Kebet or its Affiliates, Kebet Escrow to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees. <br><br>
    Client acknowledges and agrees that for both Hourly Contracts and Fixed-Price Contracts, failure by Client to decline or dispute an Hourly Invoice or request for payment is an authorization and instruction to release payment, as described more fully in the applicable Escrow Instructions. <br><br>
     <h2> DISBURSEMENTS TO FREELANCERS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS </h2>
    Under the relevant Escrow Instructions, Kebet Escrow disburses funds that are available in the applicable Freelancer Escrow Account and payable to a Freelancer upon Freelancer’s request. A Freelancer can request disbursement of available funds any time on a one-time basis or by setting up an automatic disbursement schedule. If Freelancer does not request a disbursement, Kebet will automatically disburse available funds no more than 60 days after the Freelancer Fees are released to the Freelancer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow Account is less than the Minimum Threshold. For purposes of the Terms of Service, a “Minimum Threshold” is either <br><br>
    (a) 1000 for Freelancers within Ethiopia, When the funds in the Freelancer Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is paused and the available and payable funds are released on the earlier of: <br><br>
     (i) Freelancer’s request; <br><br>
    (ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold; or<br><br>
     (iii) 180 days after the funds are available in the Freelancer Escrow Account. <br><br>
    Hourly Contracts. Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the dispute period and the five-day security period. <br><br>
    Fixed-Price Contracts. Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the five-day security period after the funds are released as provided in the applicable Escrow Instructions. The security period begins after Client accepts and approves work submitted by Freelancer. <br><br>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions, Kebet Escrow, in its sole discretion and except as prohibited by applicable law, may refuse to process, may hold the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts and offset amounts owed to us, or take such other actions with respect to the Escrow Account as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion if: <br><br>
    (a) we require additional information, such as Freelancer’s tax information, government-issued identification or other proof of identity, address, or date of birth; <br><br>
    (b) we have reason to believe the Freelancer Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback; <br><br>
    (c) we suspect a User has committed or attempted to commit fraud or other illicit acts on or through the Site; <br><br>
     (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or other Terms of Service; or<br><br>
     (e) we deem it necessary in connection with any investigation or required by applicable law. If, after investigation, we determine that the hold on the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees is no longer necessary, Kebet Escrow will release such hold as soon as practicable. <br><br>
    In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we: <br><br>
    (i)	suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Project; <br><br>
    (ii)	 discover erroneous or duplicate transactions; or<br><br>
    (iii)	  have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment Method used by you, or used by your Client if you are a Freelancer, despite our provision of the Site Services in accordance with this Agreement. You agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by instructing Kebet Escrow to (and Kebet Escrow will have the right to) charge the applicable Escrow Account, and any other accounts you hold with us, offsetting any amounts determined to be owing, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your Payment Method, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we are unable to obtain such reimbursement, we may, in addition to any other remedies available under applicable law, temporarily or permanently revoke your access to the Site and Site Services and close your Account. <br><br>
    
    <h2> NON-PAYMENT </h2>
    If Client is in “default”, meaning the Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts when due under the Terms of Service, or a written agreement for payment terms incorporating the Terms of Service (signed by an authorized representative of Kebet), Kebet will be entitled to the remedies described in this Section 6.4 in addition to such other remedies that may be available under applicable law or in such written agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Client will be deemed to be in default on the earliest occurrence of any of the following: <br><br>
    (a) Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees when due; <br><br>
     (b) Client fails to pay a balance that is due or to bring, within a reasonable period of time but no more than 30 days after accrual of the charge, an account current after a credit or debit card is declined or expires; <br><br>
    (c) Client fails to pay an invoice issued to the Client by Kebet within the time period agreed or, if no period is agreed, within 30 days; <br><br>
    (d) Client initiates a chargeback with a bank or other financial institution resulting in a charge made by Kebet for Freelancer Fees or such other amount due being reversed to the Client; or <br><br>
    (e) Client takes other actions or fails to take any action that results in a negative or past-due balance on the Client’s account. <br><br>
    If Client is in default, we may, without notice, temporarily or permanently close Client’s Account and revoke Client’s access to the Site and Site Services, including Client’s authority to use the Site to process any additional payments, enter into Service Contracts, or obtain any additional Freelancer Services from other Users through the Site. However, Client will remain responsible for any amounts that accrue on any open Projects at the time a limitation is put on the Client’s Account as a result of the default. <br><br>
    Kebet Escrow or another Affiliate; make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities; and cooperate with credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities in any investigation or prosecution. <br><br>
    Kebet does not guarantee that Client is able to pay or will pay Freelancer Fees and Kebet is not liable for Freelancer Fees if Client is in default. Freelancer may use the dispute process as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions in order to recover funds from Client in the event of a default or may pursue such other remedies against Client as Freelancer chooses. If Kebet recovers funds from a Client in default pursuant to this Section 6.4, Kebet will disburse any portion attributable to Freelancer Fees to the applicable Freelancer to the extent not already paid by Client or credited by Kebet through any Payment Protection program. <br><br>
    <h2> NO RETURN OF FUNDS AND NO CHARGEBACKS </h2>
    Client acknowledges and agrees that Kebet or its Affiliates, Kebet Escrow will charge or debit Client’s designated Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees incurred as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement and that once Kebet or its Affiliates, Kebet Escrow, charges or debits the Client’s designated Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees, the charge or debit is non-refundable, except as otherwise required by applicable law. Client also acknowledges and agrees that the Terms of Service provide a dispute resolution process as a way for Client resolve disputes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Client therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider to charge back any Freelancer Fees or other fees charged pursuant to the Terms of Service for any reason. A chargeback in breach of the foregoing obligation is a material breach of the Terms of Service. If Client initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Client agrees that Kebet or its Affiliates, Kebet Escrow, may dispute or appeal the chargeback and institute collection action against Client and take such other action it deems appropriate. <br><br>
    <h2> PAYMENT METHODS </h2>
    In order to use certain Site Services, Client must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method. <br><br>
    Client hereby authorizes Kebet, Kebet Escrow, as applicable, to run bank account authorizations on all bank accounts provided by Client, to store banking or other financial details as Client’s method of payment consistent with our Privacy Policy, and to charge Client’s bank account (or any other Payment Method) for the Freelancer Fees and any other amounts owed under the Terms of Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers to process payments and manage your Payment Method information. <br><br>
    By providing Payment Method information through the Site and authorizing payments with the Payment Method, Client represents, warrants, and covenants that: <br><br>
    (a) Client is legally authorized to provide such information; <br><br>
    (b) Client is legally authorized to make payments using the Payment Method(s); <br><br>
     (c) if Client is an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the Payment Method, that Client is authorized by the company or person to use the Payment Method to make payments on Kebet; and <br><br>
    (d) such actions do not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Client’s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. <br><br>
    When Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Client represents and warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other Terms of Service cannot be collected from Client’s Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means. <br><br>
    Kebet is not liable to any User if Kebet does not complete a transaction as a result of any limit by applicable law or your financial institution, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an account associated with such Payment Method. Kebet will make commercially reasonable efforts to work with any such affected Users to resolve such transactions in a manner consistent with this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions. <br><br>
    <h2> ETHIOPIAN BIRR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION </h2>
    The Site and the Site Services operate in Ethiopian Birr. If a User's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than Ethiopian Birr and requires currency conversion to make payments in Ethiopian Birr, the Site may display foreign currency conversion rates that Kebet, Kebet Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to Ethiopian Birr. These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Please note that the wholesale currency conversion rates at which we or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Each User, at its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to Ethiopian Birr at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in Ethiopian Birr and Kebet or its Affiliate, Kebet Escrow, as applicable, does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Kebet Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method in Ethiopian Birr and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider. The User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved. The User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk. Kebet, Kebet Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than Ethiopian Birr. Kebet, Kebet Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.

<div id="NON-CIRCUMVENTION " class="collapse col-12">
     <h1> NON-CIRCUMVENTION </h1>
    Section 7 discusses your agreement to make and receive payments only through Kebet for three years from the date you first identify or meet your Client or Freelancer on the Site, violating this Section 7 is a serious breach and your Account may be permanently suspended for violations, as detailed below. 
    <h2> MAKING PAYMENTS THROUGH KEBET </h2>
    As set out in Section 7.2, for 36 months from the start of an Kebet Relationship (the “Non- Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Site as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that person or arising out of your relationship with that person and not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered on the Site unless you pay a fee to take the relationship off of the Site (the “Conversion Fee”). For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another person through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non- Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business or its successor when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User. <br><br>
    By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to: <br><br>
    • Offer or solicit or accept any offer or solicitation from parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, invoice, pay, or receive payment in any manner other than through the Site. <br><br>
    • Invoice or report on the Site or in a Conversion Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed, made, or received between Users. <br><br>
    • Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments other than through the Site. <br><br>
    You further agree you will not initiate unsolicited communications with any User outside of the Site, including, without limitation, using any information found on the Site such as name, company name, or other information on the Site, to solicit, contact, or attempt to solicit or contact or to or find the contact information of any other User. <br><br>
    You agree to notify Kebet immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments other than through the Site in violation of this Section 7 or if you receive unsolicited contact outside of the Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to Kebet here. <br><br>
    You acknowledge and agree that a violation of any provision in this Section 7.1 is a material breach of the Terms of Service. Your Account may be permanently suspended and charged the Conversion Fee (defined above) if you violate this Section 7.1. If you refuse to accept any new version of the Terms of Service or elect not to comply with certain conditions of using the Site, such as minimum rates supported on the Site, and therefore choose to cease using the Site, you may pay the Conversion Fee for each other User you wish to continue working with on whatever terms you agree after you cease using the Site. <br><br>
    <h2> OPTING OUT </h2>
    You may opt out of the obligations in Section 7.1 with respect to each Kebet Relationship only if the Client or Freelancer pays Kebet a Conversion Fee which is a minimum of 2000 ETB and up to 10000 ETB for each Kebet Relationship. <br><br>
    The Conversion Fee may be calculated differently for Kebet Relationships when the Client is an Enterprise Client if the Enterprise Client contract with Kebet provides for different terms. <br><br>
    To inquire about or pay the Conversion Fee, send an email message to kebetfreelancing@gmail.com. <br><br>
    You understand and agree that if Kebet determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated Section 7, Kebet or its Affiliates may, to the maximum extent permitted by law (a) charge your Payment Method the Conversion Fee  if permitted by law or send you an invoice for the Conversion Fee, which you agree to pay within 30 days, <br><br>
    (b) close your Account and revoke your authorization to use the Site and Site Services, and/or <br><br>
    (c) charge you for all losses and costs (including any and all time of Kebet employees) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees. <br><br>

    <h1> AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION </h1>
    Section 13 discusses your and Kebet’s agreement about when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Kebet can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement, as detailed below. 
    <h2> TERMINATION </h2>
    Unless both you and Kebet expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein. You may provide written notice to legalnotices@Kebet.com. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Site and Site Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Kebet is not a party to any Service Contract between Users. Consequently, User understands and acknowledges that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract or Project entered into between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree <br><br>
    (a) you hereby instruct Kebet to close any open contracts; <br><br>
     (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site; <br><br>
    (c) Kebet will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Project or related transaction between you and another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Kebet for any Site Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Freelancers for any Freelancer Services. <br><br>
    Without limiting Kebet’s other rights or remedies, we may, but are not obligated to, temporarily or indefinitely revoke or limit access to the Site or Site Services, deny your registration, or permanently revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to you if: <br><br>
    (i)	you breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other provisions of the Terms of Service; <br><br>
    (ii)	we suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us; or (iii) we believe, in our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users, or Kebet or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity. If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Kebet’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law. <br><br>
    You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows: <br><br>
    IF KEBET DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, KEBET HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: <br><br>
    (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, <br><br>
    (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE. YOU AGREE THAT KEBET WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE. <br><br>
    <h2> ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSURE </h2>
    Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you keep on the Site and any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Kebet will have no liability whatsoever. Kebet, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of your Account information. 
    <h2> SURVIVAL </h2>
    After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Kebet from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

    <h1> DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND KEBET </h1>
    Section 14 discusses your agreement with Kebet and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and, if you are Ethiopia, that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we can’t resolve the dispute informally, as detailed below. 
    <h2> DISPUTE PROCESS, ARBITRATION, AND SCOPE </h2>
    If a dispute arises between you and Kebet or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively. Accordingly, unless you opt out as provided in Section 14.4.4 below, you, Kebet, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy that arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with Kebet (including without limitation any claimed employment with Kebet or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Kebet, or the Site Services (each, a “Claim”) in accordance with this Section 14 (sometimes referred to as the “Arbitration Provision”). <br><br>
    Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Site, Site Services, the Terms of Service, any Service Contract, escrow payments or agreements, any payments or monies you claim are due to you from 
    Kebet or our Affiliates or successors, trade secrets, unfair competition, false advertising, consumer protection, privacy, compensation, classification, minimum wage, seating, expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, termination, discrimination, retaliation 
    Disputes between the parties that may not be subject to pre–dispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) or as provided by an Act of Congress or lawful, enforceable Executive Order, are excluded from the coverage of this Agreement. 
    <h2> CHOICE OF LAW </h2>
    The Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws Ethiopia, any Claims made by any Freelancer located within Ethiopia will be governed by the law of the country in which such Freelancer resides. 
    <h2> INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION </h2>
    Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you and Kebet agree to first notify each other of the Claim. You agree to notify Kebet of the Claim by email to legalnotices@kebet.com, and Kebet agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a “Notice”). You and Kebet then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and contact information, so that you or Kebet, as applicable, may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim. Both you and Kebet will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action. 
    <h2> BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER (DOES NOT APPLY TO USERS LOCATED OUTSIDE ETHIOPIA AND ITS TERRITORIES) 
    </h2> 
    This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users except Users located outside of Ethiopia and its territories. <br><br>
    In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the 
    applicable Notice, you, Kebet, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding arbitration before an arbitrator from JAMS, instead of a court or jury. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. 
    <h4> SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION</h4>
    This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim (defined above) the parties may have and survives after your relationship with Kebet ends. Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms of Service and the Kebet Payroll Agreement. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. If for any reason JAMS will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator. <br><br>
    Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures’ Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect. Arbitration of disputes brought by a User that allege a violation of a consumer protection statute also will be subject to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, and such arbitrations will be conducted in the same state and within 15 miles of where the User is located. Claims by Freelancers that allege employment or worker classification disputes or will be conducted in the state and within 15 miles of where Freelancer is located in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The applicable JAMS arbitration rules may be found at www.jamsadr.com or by searching online for “JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,” “JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules,” or “JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.” Any dispute regarding the applicability of a particular set of JAMS rules shall be resolved exclusively by the arbitrator. Any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person. <br><br>
    You and Kebet will follow the applicable JAMS rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration under the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, the Freelancer will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, with Kebet to make up the difference, if any. In any arbitration under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures’ Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect in which a User makes a claim under a consumer protection statute, the User will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, or $250.00, whichever is less, with Kebet to make up the difference, if any. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction. <br><br>
    This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between Kebet and you that is or was already pending in a state or federal court or arbitration before the expiration of the opt-out period set forth in Section 14.4.4, below. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no amendment to this Arbitration Provision will apply to any matter pending in an arbitration proceeding brought under this Section 14 unless all parties to that arbitration consent in writing to that amendment. <br><br>
    This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for worker’s compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits. <br><br>
    Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Ethiopian Department of Labor, Ethiopian Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration. Kebet will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. <br><br>
    <h4> INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION </h4>
    This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable. <br><br>
    In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.3.3, below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, you and Kebet agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. <br><br>
    <h4> CLASS AND COLLECTIVE WAIVER </h4>
    Both you and Kebet agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which <br><br>
    (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and <br><br>
    (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. You and Kebet agree that you will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with 
    discipline as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, Kebet may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims. 
    <h4> RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION </h4>
    You may opt out of the Arbitration Provision contained in this Section 14 by notifying Kebet in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Site. To opt out, you must send a written notification to Kebet this written notification to legalnotices@kebet.com.

    (b) your name, <br><br>
    (c) your address, <br><br>
    (d) your telephone number, <br><br>
    (e) your email address, and<br><br>
     (f) a statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the Arbitration Provision. <br><br>
    If you do not opt out as provided in this Section 14.4.4, continuing your relationship with Kebet constitutes mutual acceptance of the terms of this Arbitration Provision by you and Kebet. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Agreement and the Arbitration Provision. <br><br>
     Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision. <br><br>
    This Arbitration Provision replaces all prior agreements regarding the arbitration of disputes and is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision. In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.4.3, above, is deemed to be unenforceable, you and Kebet agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. <br><br>

    <h1> GENERAL </h1>
    Section 15 discusses additional terms of the agreement between you and Kebet, including that the Terms of Service contain our full agreement, how the agreement will be interpreted and applied, and your agreement not to access the Site from certain locations, as detailed below. 
    <h2> ENTIRE AGREEMENT </h2>
    This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Service, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between you and Kebet relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in the Terms of Service are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though Kebet drafted the Terms of Service, you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the Terms of Service. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of the Terms of Service arises, no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring you or Kebet because of the authorship of any provision of the Terms of Service. 
     <h2> MODIFICATIONS; WAIVER </h2>
    No modification or amendment to the Terms of Service will be binding upon Kebet unless they are agreed in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Kebet or posted on the Site by Kebet. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User Agreement. 
    <h2> ASSIGNABILITY </h2>
    User may not assign the Terms of Service, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without Kebet’s prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Kebet. Kebet may freely assign this Agreement and the other Terms of Service without User’s consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Terms of Service are binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs, and permitted assigns of the parties. 
    <h2> SEVERABILITY; INTERPRETATION </h2>
    If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement or the other Terms of Service is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction. 
    <h2> FORCE MAJEURE </h2>
    The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform, or any delay in performance of, any obligation hereunder for a reasonable period due to labor disturbances, accidents, fires, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party. 
    <h2> PREVAILING LANGUAGE AND LOCATION </h2>
    The English language Amharic version of the Terms of Service will be controlling in all respects and will prevail in case of any inconsistencies with translated versions, if any. The Site is controlled and operated from our facilities in Ethiopia. <br><br>
    ACCESS OF THE SITE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES <br><br>
    Kebet makes no representations that the Site is appropriate or available for use outside of Ethiopia. Those who access or use the Site from other jurisdictions do so at their own risk and are entirely responsible for their own action.  <br><br>
